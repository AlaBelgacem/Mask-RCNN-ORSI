# Mask-RCNN-ORSI


This project aims to employ adaptive mask Region-based Convolutional Network (mask-RCNN) for multi-class object detection in remote sensing images, addressing challenges such as scale variability, small object size, and limited annotated data through transfer learning and fine-tuning, following the CRISP-DM methodology for systematic data mining and model development.
